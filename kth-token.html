        KTH: the Official Token of the Knuth Development Team
      </h1>
      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        KTH is the official <i>SEP20</i> token of the Knuth development team.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Knuth team offers a Bitcoin Cash node and development platform with
        a special focus on high performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        SEP20 stands for "SmartBCH Expansion Proposal number 20". It is the
        SmartBCH equivalent to an ERC20 on Ethereum, or a BEP20 on Binance Smart
        Chain.
      </p>
      <p>
        SmartBCH is an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) and Web3 compatible
        sidechain of Bitcoin Cash with a special focus on high throughput and
        low transaction fees.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bitcoin Cash brings sound money to the world, fulfilling the original
        promise of Bitcoin as "Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash".
      </p>
      <p>
        SmartBCH is to Ethereum what Bitcoin Cash is to Bitcoin BTC: A
        blockchain with better capabilities that is also more affordable.
        Bitcoin Cash brings affordable, secure, uncensorable, borderless,
        worldwide payments to the world - and SmartBCH does the same for
        decentralized finance (DeFi).
      </p>
      <p>
        SmartBCH supports Bitcoin Cash to achieve its mission by attracting more
        attention and funds to the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p>
        The KTH token opens a new way for the Bitcoin Cash community to support
        its developers - therefore helping Bitcoin Cash to achieve its mission.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to showing their support, KTH holders can earn passive
        income by providing liquidity on decentralized exchanges - and they will
        benefit from premium privileges such as access to future airdrops,
        liquidity provider rewards and voting rights with regard to tokenomics.
      </p>
      <h2>KTH Token Specifications</h2>
      <p>
        Contract Address: 0xc70c7718c7f1ccd906534c2c4a76914173ec2c44 <br />
        Type: SEP20 <br />Token Decimals: 18 <br />
        Total Supply on Chain: 10,000,000,000 <br />Additional token mints
        possible: No <br />Token burning: Yes - specifics will be voted upon by
        KTH holders
      </p>
      <h2>KTH Tokenomics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          50% of the supply will be distributed to the liquidity providers. Each
          liquidity provider receives a share of the weekly distribution - which
          is proportional to his or her share in the liquidity pool.
        </li>
        <li>
          25% of the supply is destined to be distributed via airdrops, contests
          or donations. A fraction of these 25% can be permanently removed from
          the supply via coin burning.
        </li>
        <li>
          The remaining 25% of the supply are distributed among the Knuth
          project developers.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>KTH Mission and Goals</h2>
      <p>The KTH token's mission can be stated in one line:</p>
      <p>KTH aims at helping Bitcoin Cash to achieve its mission.</p>
      <p>
        The best way to unpack and explore this mission statement is by starting
        with the mission of Bitcoin Cash.
      </p>
      <h2>Bitcoin Cash Mission</h2>
      <p>
        The mission of Bitcoin Cash is to become the world's preferred currency
        - a borderless, immutable, uncensorable, fast, quick, affordable and
        reliable payment method which can be used for worldwide everyday
        commerce by every human and every machine. The mission is to be a true
        peer-to-peer electronic cash system which makes financial services
        accessible to everybody - also to those who haven't had them. Bitcoin
        Cash wants to bank the unbanked - all the while removing the need for
        middlemen. Bitcoin Cash wants to give the people the power over their
        own money.
      </p>
      <h2>
        The Keys to Achieving the Mission: Community, Adoption and Technology
      </h2>
      <p>
        In order to enable Bitcoin Cash to achieve its ambitious mission,
        several parts need to symbiotically work together. These are technology,
        community and adoption - and their cooperation makes the whole more than
        just the sum of its parts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every crypto currency needs good technology. In the case of Bitcoin Cash
        reliability, high performance and scalability are of the utmost
        importance for achieving the goal of becoming the world's preferred
        currency.
      </p>
      <p>
        In case of Bitcoin Cash the technology is developed by multiple
        development teams - such as the Knuth team. It is the technology that
        enables the community to further the adoption of the crypto currency.
        Without the developers, there is no technology. And without technology,
        there is no crypto currency. And of course, technology needs adoption.
        Without adoption even the best technology is useless. It needs users.
        And these users need to be onboarded by the community. Only when good
        technology meets adoption, the technology serves its purpose. It is a
        virtuous circle - or a symbiotic relationship.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, the developers depend on the support from the community.
        This support has historically been given in the form of donations.
      </p>
      <h2>The Role of the KTH Token</h2>
      <p>
        The KTH token opens up a novel way for the community to support its
        developers: Instead of - or in addition to - sending donations, the
        community can purchase the KTH token. By holding - or using this token
        as a tipping token, the community members demonstrate their support of
        Bitcoin Cash and its developers. The KTH token shows the holders'
        support of the Bitcoin Cash development in general - and of the Knuth
        development team in particular.
      </p>
      <p>
        KTH holders with a substantial position will benefit from a membership
        in a premium Telegram group where they have direct access to the Knuth
        development team and they can exercise their voting rights. They will be
        allowed to decide on several aspects of the KTH token - one of which
        being a token burn rate.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to the described use cases, farming rewards will be
        available to KTH liquidity providers or holders. This means that the
        token holders can support the Bitcoin Cash development - and earn
        passive income at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the amount of financial support from the KTH token allows for it, the
        Knuth developers are happy to support other projects in the BCH
        ecosystem financially.
      </p>
      <h2>The Role of SmartBCH for the Success of Bitcoin Cash</h2>
      <p>
        SmartBCH is an EVM compatible and Web3 capable sidechain of Bitcoin
        Cash. It ports the philosophy and design decisions behind Bitcoin Cash
        over to the world of decentralized finance (DeFi). Its goal is to
        provide affordable, reliable and fast DeFi transactions for everyone -
        not just the wealthy. So far, the existing DeFi platforms have either
        excluded less wealthy people from participating - due to high
        transaction costs - or they have sacrificed decentralization and
        therefore resilience and censorship resistance for lower fees. SmartBCH
        combines the advantages of both approaches - and eliminates their
        respective disadvantages - by taking advantage of the inherent
        parallelism of current computer architectures and by leveraging the
        decentralized Bitcoin Cash proof of work network for electing SmartBCH
        validators. In this way SmartBCH benefits from a proof of work consensus
        mechanism without incurring any extra
      </p>
      <p>
        mining overhead and energy consumption. SmartBCH is simultaneously
        secured by proof of work and as energy efficient as a proof of stake
        blockchain.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to providing affordable decentralized finance to the world,
        SmartBCH will also help the Bitcoin Cash network by providing extra
        income to miners - which increases the hash rate stability and therefore
        reduces the risk of attacks on the network. Furthermore, SmartBCH
        introduces a deflationary mechanism to the Bitcoin Cash network with
        "fee burning": 50% of the transaction fees on SmartBCH are burnt - both
        on the SmartBCH sidechain and on the Bitcoin Cash main chain. In
        addition to fee burning, the Bitcoin Cash coins which are bridged to
        SmartBCH are locked on the main chain and therefore, they further reduce
        the supply. These mechanisms will help Bitcoin Cash's price to
        appreciate. And this in turn means free publicity - which helps with
        onboarding new users, ultimately pathing the way to the main goal of
        becoming the world's preferred currency - and replacing fiat currencies
        and middlemen - such as banks and centralized exchanges.
      </p>
      <h2>The Knuth Development Team</h2>
      <p>
        Knuth is one of multiple Bitcoin Cash full node implementations. The
        team's focus lies on creating a high performance implementation of the
        Bitcoin protocol. The software is especially suited for users requiring
        extra capacity and resilience. It is a full node software client, but
        also a development platform. It is designed for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Miners and mining pools running competitive operations.</li>
        <li>Exchanges in need of dependable full indexation.</li>
        <li>
          Companies and businesses with the intention of building applications.
        </li>
        <li>Developers who want to take their projects to new levels.</li>
        <li>Newcomers taking their first steps in the blockchain ecosystem.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In Bitcoin Cash not only the network is decentralized. The development
        is also decentralized - a fact that the Bitcoin Cash community takes
        pride in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Knuth is not just one more full node implementation for the sake of
        decentralisation. Knuth was in fact one of the first Bitcoin Cash
        implementations. The Knuth team played a crucial role in starting the
        Bitcoin Cash hardfork - when it became evident that the Bitcoin BTC part
        of the Bitcoin community decided against further pursuing the goal of
        developing Bitcoin as the peer-to-peer electronic cash which it was
        created to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        By buying, holding, using and providing liquidity for this token, the
        token holders express their appreciation for Bitcoin Cash development in
        general - and for the Knuth project in particular. The Knuth team helped
        to make Bitcoin Cash what it is today. And it is the community's support
        which enables the developers to help to keep it going.
      </p>
      <h2>What Your Support Helps to Develop</h2>
      <p>
        The Knuth project members do not only work in their own project, they
        also help other Bitcoin Cash related projects - such as Bitcoin Cash
        Node and SmartBCH. Detailed information about collaborations can be
        found in their blog at
        <a href="https://read.cash/@kth" target="_blank"
          >https://read.cash/@kth</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        To exemplarily mention one such collaboration: The Knuth developers - in
        particular Fernando Pelliccioni in collaboration with Calin Culianu from
        the Bitcoin Cash Node team - are currently working on the next killer
        features of Bitcoin Cash:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Native Introspection opcodes and</li>
        <li>64-bit Script integers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These features are crucial for the bridge between Bitcoin Cash and its
        SmartBCH sidechain - as confirmed by Kui Wang - the lead developer of
        SmartBCH. The features are planned to be included in the May 2022
        Bitcoin Cash network upgrade.
      </p>
      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        The following quote by Fernando Pelliccioni - the lead developer of the
        Knuth project - summarises the idea behind the KTH token and its
        mission:
      </p>
      <p>"We believe that BCH is the true p2p electronic cash.</p>
      <p>
        I think SmartBCH is going to give BCH a big boost - that's why we are
        working to make all this work better and better.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also believe (some of the BCH supporters) that the launch of these
        tokens will help attract capital from other Blockchains such as ETH and
        BSC.
      </p>
      <p>Let's see"</p>
      <p>
        Bitcoin Cash BCH has an ambitious mission. However, it also has the
        support of the best community in crypto. And the community is a very
        important part of any crypto currency. It lives and thrives in symbiosis
        with the technology that the developers provide.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Bitcoin Cash community is not exclusively driven by the desire to
        profit. Many BCH supporters are mostly driven by the desire to make this
        world a better place and to improve the lives of all people. SmartBCH is
        the next step in achieving this mission. And tokens such as KTH allow
        the community to directly support its developers. Supporting Bitcoin
        Cash BCH has always been the right choice from a moral perspective.
        SmartBCH will help making it the right choice from a financial
        perspective as well. Not just the right decision for the individual -
        but for the whole world.
